# MÍMIR: Cognitive Diagnostic & Incident-Response Agent

An end-to-end, production-grade LLM system for DevOps, SRE, and cloud-infrastructure reasoning.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Mímir** is an advanced LLM-driven cognitive workflow agent designed for incident response, DevOps troubleshooting, and cloud/SRE diagnostics. It's engineered as a real-world, industry-standard AI assistant, not a toy chatbot.

It integrates several advanced AI and software engineering components:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- **PEFT Fine-Tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)**
- **Structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning**
- **Quantization-aware Serving (vLLM / TGI)**
- **Incident-specific Evaluation & Ablations**
- **Guardrails, safety layers, and multi-turn memory**
- **Production-quality engineering workflows**

The core goal is to analyze logs, alerts, and metrics, retrieve relevant documentation (SOPs, runbooks, docs), and reason step-by-step to produce actionable root-cause analyses and suggest safe mitigation steps consistent with SRE best practices.

## 💻 Core Use Case: Incident Assistance

Mímir assists engineers by providing structured diagnostics during incidents, including but not limited to:

- Service downtime
- Pod crash loops
- Failing deployments
- Memory/CPU saturation
- Authentication/configuration errors
- Networking issues and database latency spikes
- Container-level faults and alert rule anomalies
- CI/CD pipeline errors

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Enables grounded reasoning by fetching relevant context from a knowledge base.

- **Custom Ingestion**: Kubernetes docs, AWS/GCP playbooks, Google SRE Handbook, DevOps SOPs/runbooks, and example diagnostic cases.
- **Workflow**: Chunking, cleaning, embedding, indexing, and Top-k retrieval with context injection into the LLM.

### 2. PEFT Fine-Tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)

Uses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on structured incident reasoning and troubleshooting data.

- **Objective**: Improve reasoning structure, reduce hallucinations, and align outputs with DevOps best practices.
- **Implementation**: Open-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA/Mistral) + LoRA/QLoRA adapters, trained via TRL SFTTrainer + PEFT.

### 3. Structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning

The model is fine-tuned to output clean, interpretable, step-by-step reasoning using a defined schema:

1. Symptom Identification
2. Hypothesis Generation
3. Checks / Verifications
4. Root Cause Conclusion
5. Recommended Action Steps

### 4. Incident Evaluation & Ablation Harness

A full evaluation pipeline to rigorously test system performance.

- **Comparisons**: Baseline vs PEFT, RAG vs No-RAG, Zero-shot CoT vs Fine-tuned CoT.
- **Ablations**: Testing chunk size, top-k retriever variations, latency, and performance.
- **Metrics**: LLM-as-a-Judge scoring for quality, summarized in tables, plots, and a report.md.

### 5. Guardrails & Safety Layer

Ensures the agent is safe, reliable, and operates within defined boundaries.

- Rejects unsupported domains and filters junk/off-topic inputs.
- Restricts high-risk operational advice.
- Generates "safe mitigations" aligned with industry SRE practices and requires multi-step verification.

### 6. Model Serving Optimization

Engineered for high-throughput, low-latency inference.

- **Servers**: vLLM and TGI (Text Generation Inference) for robust, containerized deployment.
- **Optimization**: 4-bit quantization (QLoRA, GPTQ, AWQ) for reduced memory footprint.
- **API**: Async FastAPI inference API. Everything runs in Docker.

### 7. Multi-Turn Conversational Memory

Maintains short contextual memory to support multi-step incident resolution.

- **Mechanism**: Rolling window prompts, incident-session tracking, and token budgeting via context trimming.
